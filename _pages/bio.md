## About Me

I work as a data engineer, building systems that turn raw, fragmented data into reliable inputs for real-world decision-making. Over the past few years, I’ve worked on cloud-native data pipelines, automation workflows, and analytics platforms used in regulated and operationally critical environments.

My work often sits at the intersection of engineering, data quality, and decision-making — where correctness, traceability, and long-term maintainability matter more than speed alone. I care about building systems that people can trust, understand, and evolve over time.

Outside of work, I use this site to think in public — writing about books, music, cinema, coding, and ideas that help me understand how complex systems (technical or human) actually work.

## What I Do

I work primarily in the **data engineering** space, focusing on:

- Designing scalable and maintainable data pipelines  
- Automating ingestion, transformation, and validation workflows  
- Building analytics-ready datasets for planning, monitoring, and forecasting  
- Supporting regulated and compliance-sensitive data use cases  

Over the past few years, I’ve worked across multiple domains, including:

- **Clinical & Life Sciences Data**
  - Clinical trial planning and site activation forecasting  
  - Audit, inspection, and compliance reporting

## Research & Academic Work

Earlier in my academic journey, I worked on projects exploring machine learning, computer vision, and embedded systems. Below are selected academic projects with links to both the research papers and their corresponding project pages.

- **Facial Emotions and Behaviour Monitoring System using DNN**  
  A deep-learning–based system for recognising facial emotions and behavioural patterns using computer vision techniques.

- **Voice-Based Robotic Vehicle with Obstacle Avoidance**  
  An embedded system integrating voice control and obstacle detection to enable autonomous robotic navigation.

## Interests

Beyond professional work, I spend time thinking and writing about:

- **Books** — especially ideas that age well  
- **Music** — artists and albums with lasting emotional impact  
- **Cinema** — storytelling, pacing, and character-driven films  
- **Coding** — as a craft, not just a tool  
- Writing as a way to clarify thinking  

These interests shape much of the writing on this site.

## How I Work

A few principles that guide how I approach work:

- I value clarity over cleverness  
- I optimise for long-term maintainability  
- I prefer systems that are observable and debuggable  
- I believe good engineering supports better human decisions
