    <h1>Hi, I’m Siddhardh</h1>

    <p class="hero-bio">
      I’m someone with a deep curiosity for ideas, art, and learning.
      I write to understand things better — music, cinema, coding,
      and thoughts shaped by observation rather than expertise.
    </p>

    <p class="hero-bio">
      This is a personal space to think in public and grow over time.
